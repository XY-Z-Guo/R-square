# Ai and Bansal (2016) think for GDP announcement "are made monthly, but most uncertainty about Q1 growth is resolved once the advance estimate is published and most learning by the markets will occur prior to this release. For this reason we will focus only on the 4 advance estimate release dates every year."
# Savor and Wilson (2013) said "We drop the CPI after PPI announcements become available in Feb. 1971, since PPI numbers for a given month are always released a few days earlier, thereby dimin- ishing the news content of CPI numbers." Since their results are robust to the inclusion of CPI, I prefer to do the same thing.
# In my sample, eight FOMC meetings are unscheduled. I'm not sure whether I should exclude them as Savor and Wilson (2013) did. I prefer to keep them.
# Should I consider all these as robustness tests?
